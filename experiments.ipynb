    "## Project Description: Next Word Using LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Overview:\n",
    "This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a given squence of words. The model is buit using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. The project includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Data Collection: We use the text of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\"  as our dataset. This rich, complex text provides a good challenge for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Data Preprocessing:  The text data is tokenized, converted into sequences, and padded to ensure uniform input lengths. The sequences are then spilt into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Model Building: An LSTM model is constructed with an embedded layer two LSTM layers and a dense output layer with a softmax activation function to predict the probability of the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Model Training: The model is evaluated using a set of example sentences to test its ability to predict the next word accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using a set of example sentences to test its ability to predict the next word accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- Deployment: A Streamlit web application is developed to allow users to input a sequence of words and get the predicted next word in real-time."
